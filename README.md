# Connect4
Connect4 Project

Easy to use connect 4 game. 
Includes a bot to play against, with different difficulty-levels.

The bot basicly tries a specific number of moves and picks out the best. The number of moves is selected by
the player and represented by the level of the bot.
The evaluation of each move is done by a simple game-theory calculation. 

If you have any questions about the project feel free to contact me. :)
